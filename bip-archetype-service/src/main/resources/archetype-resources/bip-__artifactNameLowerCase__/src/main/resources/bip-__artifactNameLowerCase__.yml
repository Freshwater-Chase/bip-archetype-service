 ${symbol_pound} set the hystrix.wrappers.enabled property to true. Doing so will auto configure an Hystrix concurrency strategy

    metrics:
      rollingStats:
        ${symbol_pound} This property sets the duration of the statistical rolling window, in milliseconds. 
        ${symbol_pound} This is how long Hystrix keeps metrics for the circuit breaker to use and for publishing 
        ${symbol_pound} Default Value: 10000
        timeInMilliseconds: 20000
      ${symbol_pound} This property sets the time to wait, in milliseconds, between allowing health snapshots to be taken that calculate 
      ${symbol_pound} success and error percentages and affect circuit breaker status. 
      ${symbol_pound} Default Value: 500
      healthSnapshot: 
        intervalInMilliseconds: 1000
    circuitBreaker:
      ${symbol_pound} This property sets the amount of time, after tripping the circuit, to reject requests 
      ${symbol_pound} before allowing attempts again to determine if the circuit should again be closed.
      ${symbol_pound} Default Value: 5000
      sleepWindowInMilliseconds: 5000
      ${symbol_pound} This property sets the minimum number of requests in a rolling window that will trip the circuit.
      ${symbol_pound} Default Value: 20
      requestVolumeThreshold: 20
    execution:
      isolation:
        ${symbol_pound} strategy: SEMAPHORE
        thread:
          ${symbol_pound} This property sets the time in milliseconds after which the caller will observe a timeout and 
          ${symbol_pound} walk away from the command execution. Hystrix marks the HystrixCommand as a TIMEOUT, and performs fallback 
          ${symbol_pound} logic. Note that there is configuration for turning off timeouts per-command, if that is desired (see command.timeout.enabled).
